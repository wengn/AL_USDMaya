        useful in several scenarios:
        
        - In a pipeline that does pruning (for complexity management)
        by deactivating prims composed from asset references, when we
        deactivate a purpose="render" prim, we will be able to discover
        and additionally deactivate its associated purpose="proxy" prim,
        so that preview renders reflect the pruning accurately.
        
        - DCC importers may be able to make more aggressive optimizations
        for interactive processing and display if they can discover the proxy
        for a given render prim.
        
        - With a little more work, a Hydra-based application will be able
        to map a picked proxy prim back to its render geometry for selection.

        \\note It is only valid to author the proxyPrim relationship on
        prims whose purpose is "render".'''

        doc = '''Purpose is a concept we have found useful in our pipeline for 
        classifying geometry into categories that can each be independently
        included or excluded from traversals of prims on a stage, such as
        rendering or bounding-box computation traversals.  The fallback
        purpose, default indicates that a prim has "no special purpose"
        and should generally be included in all traversals.  Subtrees rooted
        at a prim with purpose render should generally only be included
        when performing a "final quality" render.  Subtrees rooted at a prim
        with purpose proxy should generally only be included when 
        performing a lightweight proxy render (such as openGL).  Finally,
        subtrees rooted at a prim with purpose guide should generally
        only be included when an interactive application has been explicitly
        asked to "show guides". 
        
        In the previous paragraph, when we say "subtrees rooted at a prim",
        we mean the most ancestral or tallest subtree that has an authored,
        non-default opinion.  If the purpose of </RootPrim> is set to 
        "render", then the effective purpose of </RootPrim/ChildPrim> will
        be "render" even if that prim has a different authored value for
        purpose.  <b>See ComputePurpose() for details of how purpose 
        inherits down namespace</b>.
        
        As demonstrated in UsdGeomBBoxCache, a traverser should be ready to 
        accept combinations of included purposes as an input.
        
        Purpose render can be useful in creating "light blocker"
        geometry for raytracing interior scenes.  Purposes render and
        proxy can be used together to partition a complicated model
        into a lightweight proxy representation for interactive use, and a
        fully realized, potentially quite heavy, representation for rendering.
        One can use UsdVariantSets to create proxy representations, but doing
        so requires that we recompose parts of the UsdStage in order to change
        to a different runtime level of detail, and that does not interact
        well with the needs of multithreaded rendering. Purpose provides us with
        a better tool for dynamic, interactive complexity management.'''
